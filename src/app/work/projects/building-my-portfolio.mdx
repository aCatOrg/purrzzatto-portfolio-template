## Overview

This portfolio was built using the [Magic Portfolio](https://once-ui.com/products/magic-portfolio) template, which is available for free under their license terms. Below, I've detailed the key improvements and customizations I implemented beyond the original template.

## Key Features

- **Subscribe Button**: Fixed the unresponsive "Subscribe" button from the original template. It now properly handles the email submission flow and collects user emails while correctly responding to email validation states.

- **Type-Safe Debounce**: Replaced the incorrectly typed debounce code used in email validation, resolving TypeScript issues and improving code reliability.

- **Gallery**: The Gallery section was enhanced to dynamically load images from the `public/images/gallery` folder, eliminating the need to manually specify hardcoded paths in the content configuration. A Next.js API route (`src/app/api/gallery/route.ts`) was implemented to handle server-side image discovery and provide dynamic loading capabilities. For optimal display, images should be named to indicate their orientation (e.g., `image_vertical.jpg` or `image_horizontal.jpg`), which helps determine the appropriate aspect ratio for layout purposes.

- **Enhanced Component Flexibility**: Improved flexibility in "Work", Carousel, and Media components to accept different child components, formats, and structures while maintaining predefined aspect ratios. Added accordions in the About section following modern CV presentation trends, organized into "Key Achievements" and "Tasks" sections.

- **MDX Code Block Enhancement**: Improved MDX code block handling to correctly process language and label information. The current implementation supports this syntax:
  ```markdown
  ~~~<language>:<label/filePath>?
  'CodeBlock'
  ~~~
  ```
  When `label/filePath` is empty, it defaults to using the language name as the label.

**Sitemap**: Updated `src/app/sitemap.ts` to conditionally include blog posts and project pages only when their respective routes (`/blog` and `/work`) are enabled in `src/resources/once-ui.config.ts`. Previously, it included them unconditionally, even for disabled routes.

## Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: For building fast, server-rendered React applications with excellent performance and SEO.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and interactive prototypes.
- **[Once UI](https://once-ui.com/)**: For styling React components with a modular, themeable design system.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**: For version control and collaborative development workflows.
- **[Canva](https://nextjs.org/)**: For quick and efficient creation of images and videos.
- **AI Tools** _(Kilo Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini)_: For AI-assisted coding, design and development acceleration.
- **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)**: For comprehensive linting and code formatting in a single, fast tool.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: For seamless web deployment and hosting. Vercel offers an intuitive deployment process - simply connect your GitHub repository and specify that it's a Next.js application for automatic builds and deployments.


## Challenges and Learnings

### Project Structure
Although the template featured comprehensive documentation and worked seamlessly out of the box, it included several built-in configurations I wasn't familiar with, such as Biome and Next.js itself. This created a learning curve as I worked to understand how the components interconnected.
nao 
Mastering Next.js routing and folder structure proved invaluable for understanding content creation and management. It enabled me to navigate components more effectively and improve project organization, such as developing a dedicated WorkExperience component for the About page.

```tsx:src/components/about/WorkExperience.tsx
const WorkExperience: React.FC<WorkExperienceProps> = ({ experience }) => {
  return (
    <Column fillWidth>
      <Row fillWidth horizontal="between" vertical="end" marginBottom="4">
```
### MDX Composition
Learning the structure of MDX files—including Frontmatter metadata and markdown content—helped me understand why certain features worked seamlessly. Recognizing that Frontmatter uses YAML syntax clarified how file parsing operates behind the scenes, preventing blind implementation of features.

### Biome
Previously reliant on Prettier for code formatting across all projects, I welcomed the opportunity to explore alternative tooling. Biome proved to be an excellent discovery, offering unified formatting and linting configuration in a single, efficient tool. I highly recommend it to fellow developers.
My `biome` setup is in the following file in my the project `root`
```json:biome.json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": false,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": false
  },
  // ... other properties ...
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "double"
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

This portfolio implementation now serves as a robust foundation for showcasing future projects. As an open-source project built on the flexible Magic Portfolio template, it provides other developers with a solid starting point for their own portfolios.

Also, for me, the modular architecture allows me to clearly separate my portfolio's core functionality from additional features I'm developing, such as an expanded blog section and other projects I am working at the moment.
