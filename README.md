# Purrzzatto Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js and inspired by the **Once UI Magic Portfolio** template. Here, I showcase my work, projects, and thoughts.

üåê **Live Demo**: [purrzzatto.com](https://www.purrzzatto.com/)

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

Building on the original Magic Portfolio template, I've added several enhancements for better functionality and flexibility. For a detailed breakdown, visit my project page: [Building My Portfolio](https://www.purrzzatto.com/work/building-my-portfolio).

- **Subscribe Button**: Fixed unresponsive button; now properly handles email submission and validation.
- **Type-Safe Debounce**: Replaced incorrect debounce typing for improved TypeScript reliability.
- **Gallery**: Dynamic image loading from `public/images/gallery` via API route; supports orientation-based naming for optimal aspect ratios.
- **Component Flexibility**: Enhanced "Work", Carousel, and Media components to accept varied child structures; added accordions in the About section.
- **MDX Code Blocks**: Improved handling of language and label syntax (e.g., `~~~<language>:<label>?`).
- **Sitemap**: Conditionally includes blogs/projects only when routes are enabled in the config.

If you find these improvements useful and use this as a starting point for your own portfolio, please consider leaving a star! ‚≠ê
